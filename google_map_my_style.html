[My Google Map Style](https://christopheribeling.github.io/GIS_briefcase/google_map_my_style.html)

The colors palette that the image produced gave me a lot of brown, tan, and beige colors. Although this is not a terribly diverse color 
scheme, it was interesting to think about different ways I could display similar colors to create an effective map.

For my land areas, I used the "burly wood" from the image since it was the lightest and would let the other features to stand out more. 
Since I wanted points of interest and other attractions to take more of the focus on the maps, I assigned the "dark olive green" and 
the "dark slate gray" to those features. I didn't want the roads to detract focus from the points of interest and attractions, so I 
assigned the "Sienna" brown color to them and increased the transparency.
